# Computational Drug Discovery

This prototype project uses regression model to predict the IC50 value of a molecule targeted to bind SARS-coronavirus 3C-like proteinase.

IC50 is the degree to which a molecule can inhibit a target protein of interest. Molecule that can strongly inhibit the protein can be screened as a potential drug candidate. Such molecules can then further be evaluated for their pharmacokinetic profile pertaining to absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity.
